## üìä Model Accuracy and Regularization (Best Epoch)

**Best Epoch:** 5

At epoch 5, the model achieved its highest validation accuracy and AUC:

| Metric          | Training | Validation |
|-----------------|----------|------------|
| Accuracy        | 0.903    | 0.875      |
| AUC             | 0.968    | 0.984      |
| Loss            | 0.252    | 0.260      |
| Precision       | 0.903    | 0.875      |
| Recall          | 0.903    | 0.875      |

### üõ°Ô∏è Regularization & Generalization Techniques Used

- **Data Augmentation:**  
  The training images were randomly rotated, shifted, and horizontally flipped to increase data diversity and improve generalization.

- **Dropout Layer:**  
  Dropout with a rate of 0.5 was applied to the dense layer, randomly disabling 50% of neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

- **Batch Normalization:**  
  Batch normalization layers were included after each convolutional layer to stabilize and accelerate training, and to provide a regularization effect.

- **Early Stopping:**  
  Training was monitored using early stopping with patience of 5 epochs. If the validation loss did not improve for 5 consecutive epochs, training was halted and the best model (with lowest validation loss) was restored.

- **Model Checkpoint:**  
  The model was automatically saved at its best validation loss during training, ensuring only the best-performing parameters are used.

---

**Summary:**  
At the fifth epoch, the model demonstrated excellent generalization with 87.5% validation accuracy and 98.4% validation AUC, thanks to robust regularization and early stopping strategies.
